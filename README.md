# CS6120 Project: Toxic Comment Scanner

# Summary

Although it has its pros and cons, the social media environment has lately become a platform forpeople to vent their rage, insecurity, and prejudices. To counteract the risks posed by this problem, wepresent preliminary language models to classify comments into six labels that represent subcategoriesof toxicity. The findings show that our baseline models provide promising results and set the directionand motivation for future improvements. We were able to (1) produce various visualizations to helpexplore and understand the data; (2) test and compare three models (logistic regression, ConvolutionalNeural Networks and BERT transformers ) that successfully label comments and found the optimalone based on our analysis.
